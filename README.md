# Coding Cookbook
A collection of coding experiments which demonstrate various technologies across
multiple languages.  All the experiments come with the neccessary means to build, deploy, and test.
As time permits, I will be adding more to this collection.

## Introduction
Throughout my career, I have found it useful to build small POCs when working on larger projects. These small POCs are made to express what I'm trying
to accomplish, eventually being implemented into the larger solution. Having several of these POCs laying around,
I have decided to clean them up and put them in a cookbook style.

## Usage
Coding Cookbook is broken down into segments of technology; these segments contain end-to-end POCs demonstrating certain techniques related to the current technology.  There are cross technology dependencies, so it is highly recommended to maintain the directory structure of the cloned repository.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get started is by cloning Coding Cookbook with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/stevenkiesling/coding-cookbook.git
```
